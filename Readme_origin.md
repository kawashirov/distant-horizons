> A mod that adds a Level of Detail System to Minecraft


# What is Distant Horizons?

Distant Horizons is a Minecraft mod that adds a Level Of Detail (LOD) system to\
render simplified chunks outside the normal render distance\
allowing for an increased view distance without harming performance.

In other words: this mod lets you see farther without turning your game into a slide show.\
If you want to see a quick demo, check out a video covering the mod here:

<br>

## Source Code Installation

### Prerequisites

* A Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java 17 (recommended) or newer. <br>
  Visit https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ for installers.
* Git or someway to clone git projects. <br> 
  Visit https://git-scm.com/ for installers.
* (Not required) Any Java IDE with plugins that support Manifold, for example Intellij IDEA.

**If using IntelliJ:**
1. Install the Manifold plugin
2. Open IDEA and import the build.gradle
3. Refresh the Gradle project in IDEA if required

**If using Eclipse: (Note that Eclipse doesn't support Manifold's preprocessor!)**
1. Run the command: `./gradlew geneclipseruns`
2. Run the command: `./gradlew eclipse`
3. Make sure eclipse has the JDK 17 installed. (This is needed so that eclipse can run minecraft)
4. Import the project into eclipse



## Switching Versions

To switch between different Minecraft versions, change `mcVer=1.?` in the `gradle.properties` file.

If running in an IDE, to ensure the IDE noticed the version change, run any gradle command to refresh gradle. (In IntellJ you will also need to do a gradle sync if it didn't happen automatically.)
>Note: There may be a `java.nio.file.FileSystemException` thrown when running the command after switching versions. To fix it, either restart your IDE (as your IDE is probably locking a file) or use a tool like LockHunter to unlock the linked file(s). (Generally it is a lib file under `common\build\lib`, `forge\build\lib`, or `fabric\build\lib`). \

## Compiling

Prerequisites:
- JDK 17 or newer

From the File Explorer:
1. Download and extract the project zip
2. Download the core from https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/distant-horizons-core and extract into a folder called `coreSubProjects`
3. Open a terminal emulator in the project folder (On Windows you can type `cmd` in the title bar)
4. Run the commands: `./gradlew assemble` (You may need to use a `.\` on Windows)
5. Merge the jars wih `./gradlew mergeJars`
6. The compiled jar file will be in the folder `Merged`

From the command line:
1. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod.git`
2. `cd minecraft-lod-mod`
3. `./gradlew assemble`
4. `./gradlew mergeJars`
5. The compiled jar file will be in the folder `Merged`

Run tests with: `./gradlew test`

>Note: You can add the arg: `-PmcVer=?` to tell gradle to build a selected MC version instead of having to modify the `gradle.properties` file. \
> Example: `./gradlew assemble -PmcVer=1.18.2`


<br>

## Compiling with Docker

`./compile <version>`

You can also locally compile the DH jars without a Java environment by using Docker. Where `<version>` is the version of Minecraft to compile for (ie `1.20.1`), or the keyword `all`. See [Versions](#minecraft-and-library-versions) for a list of all supported values.


<br>

## Other commands

`./gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh local dependencies.

`./gradlew clean` to delete any compiled code.


## Note to self

The Minecraft source code is NOT added to your workspace in an editable way. Minecraft is treated like a normal Library. Sources are there for documentation and research purposes only.

Source code uses Mojang mappings & [Parchment](https://parchmentmc.org/) mappings.

To generate the source code run `./gradlew genSources`\
If your IDE fails to auto-detect the source jars when browsing Minecraft classes; manually select the JAR file ending with -sources.jar when prompted by your IDE. <br>
(In IntelliJ it's at the top where it says "choose sources" when browsing a Minecraft class)

<br>

## Other Useful commands

Run the standalone jar: `./gradlew run`\
Build the standalone jar: `./gradlew core:build`\
Only build Fabric: `./gradlew fabric:assemble` or `./gradlew fabric:build`\
Only build Forge: `./gradlew fabric:assemble` or `./gradlew forge:build`\
Run the Fabric client (for debugging): `./gradlew fabric:runClient`\
Run the Forge client (for debugging): `./gradlew forge:runClient`

To build all versions: `./buildAll` (all builds will end up in the `Merged` folder)
